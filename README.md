## ðŸ“… Football Calendar Frontend

**Football Calendar Frontend** is the mobile companion app (Android) for viewing football matches in a clean, colorful, and animated calendar interface. It connects with a custom backend powered by openfootball data, offering a streamlined way to explore upcoming matches across various leagues and teams.

The goal of this project is to provide a fun, intuitive and visually engaging experience for football fans who want to keep track of their favorite leagues, clubs, and competitions in real-time â€” all inside a sleek calendar view.

### âœ¨ Features

- Color-coded leagues for better clarity and customization  
- Filtering by league, team, and date range  
- Minimal aesthetic with **bold accent colors**  
- Supports data updates from a remote backend (daily sync)

### ðŸ§  Tech Stack

- **Kotlin** â€” Modern, concise language for native Android development  
- **Jetpack Compose** â€” Declarative UI framework for building flexible and responsive layouts  
- **Android Studio** â€” IDE of choice for the entire development workflow

### ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy

The appâ€™s design balances **minimalism and bold expression**. We use a mostly monochromatic base (white, black, grey) enhanced by vivid accent colors to bring energy to each interaction. Animations are intentionally **over-the-top** â€” buttons squish, cards bounce, and transitions feel alive, all to make the user experience feel playful and memorable.

### ðŸš§ Current Status

Development just started. The focus is currently on building out the core UI screens, setting up navigation, and connecting to the live backend. Expect frequent updates as the visual style and features evolve.
